Here is the equivalent Go code for the given Java code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

In Go, the `main` function is the entry point of the program, similar to Java. The `fmt` package is used for printing output to the console, similar to `System.out.println` in Java.
